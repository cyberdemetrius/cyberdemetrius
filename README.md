# 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm ***Demétrius Vianna Fernandes***, a 26-year-old Cybersecurity Professional and a Bachelor of Law from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
I'm passionate about cybersecurity, low and medium-level coding, conducting pentests, ensuring compliance, and fortifying defenses against digital crimes. I also love studying offensive security. 
Most of the projects I develop here are open source and freely available for everyone.

When I'm not at the keyboard, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I like soccer, electronic sports, jiu-jitsu, and listening to music. I also love studying new topics while enjoying my playlist.
